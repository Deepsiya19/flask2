    "- **Data in URL:** Parameters are included in the URL. For example, in the URL `http://example.com/resource?param1=value1&param2=value2`, the parameters are included in the query string.\n",

    "- **Idempotent:** The operation is idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.\n",

    "- **Caching:** Responses are usually not cached. Data is not visible in the URL.\n",

    "**Templates in Flask:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates in Flask refer to files containing a mix of HTML and dynamic content, typically written using Jinja2, a template engine for Python. Templates allow you to separate the structure of your HTML from the dynamic content generated by your Flask application. This separation of concerns improves code organization and makes it easier to maintain and update your web pages.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `render_template()` function in Flask is used for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rendering HTML Pages (1 mark):**\n",
    "   - `render_template()` is the primary method for rendering HTML pages dynamically by combining static HTML content with dynamic data provided by the Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from flask import Flask, render_template\n",
    "\n",
    "   app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "   @app.route('/')\n",

    "       return render_template('index.html', title='Home', content='Welcome to the homepage')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Injecting Dynamic Data (1 mark):**\n",
    "   - It allows you to pass dynamic data from the Python code to the template. This data is then used within the HTML file to generate content dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <!-- index.html -->\n",
    "   <html>\n",
    "   <head>\n",

    "   </body>\n",
    "   </html>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Template Inheritance (Optional):**\n",
    "   - Templates support inheritance, enabling you to create a base template with a common structure and extend or override specific sections in child templates. This promotes code reuse and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <!-- base.html -->\n",
    "   <html>\n",
    "   <head>\n",
    "       <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>\n",
    "   </head>\n",
    "   <body>\n",
    "       {% block content %}{% endblock %}\n",
    "   </body>\n",
    "   </html>\n",
    "   ```\n",
